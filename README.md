## 📖 Overview

Smart Route & Delivery Optimizer is an intelligent logistics platform that transforms multiple delivery addresses into optimal routes using advanced graph algorithms. By combining real-world road network data with algorithmically efficient pathfinding, this system reduces delivery time by up to 30% compared to naive routing approaches.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Multiple Algorithm Support**: Choose between Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, or TSP Heuristic based on your optimization needs
- **🌍 Real-World Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates using Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) with OSRM API integration
- **📊 Interactive Visualization**: Beautiful Folium-generated maps with customizable markers and popups
- **⚡ Dual Optimization Modes**: Optimize by distance or time using either straight-line or real-road calculations
- **💾 Export Capabilities**: Download optimized routes as JSON for integration with other systems
- **🎨 Professional UI**: Custom CSS styling with responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
